"""LangGraph adapter (optional extra: ``pip install snagline[langgraph]``).

Wraps ``graph.stream(...)`` -- LangGraph's public streaming API -- and turns
each node update into a ``StepEvent`` for the Monitor (project.md §6.3).
Works with any framework that yields ``{node_name: state_update}`` items
(LangGraph's default ``stream_mode="updates"``), so the module has no hard
langgraph import at all; if you already have a stream of updates, you can
pass it directly.

Mapping rules:
  * one yielded update item  -> one StepEvent per node key in that item
  * ``tool_name``            -> the node name
  * ``latency_ms``           -> wall time between the previous yield and this
    one (a superstep boundary), recorded on the event as coarse per-node
    latency. Note it is NOT consumed by the CUSUM latency-anomaly detector:
    that detector scores only ``tool_call`` steps (``action_type !=
    "tool_call"`` is skipped) and deliberately ignores aggregate ``node_run``
    supersteps, since a superstep spans a whole node (often a nested subgraph
    or reasoning turn), and scoring it would flag every nested LangGraph run
    as an anomaly (issue #10). The field is still carried for hosts and sinks
    that want raw per-node timing; wrap tool leaves with a ``tool_call``
    adapter if you want their latency CUSUM-monitored.
  * ``error``                -> the node's update contains a truthy ``error``
    key, or the update value is an Exception (LangGraph signals node errors
    this way in updates mode). A node that *raises* never arrives as an
    update: LangGraph propagates the exception out of ``graph.stream()``.
    ``watch_graph`` catches it, emits one error ``StepEvent`` so the failure
    still reaches the Monitor, and re-raises so your own code sees the
    exception unchanged.
  * ``action_signature``     -> hash of (node name, sorted top-level update
    keys). Deliberately structural, not content: a node repeatedly producing
    the same *shape* of failed update is a loop; changing content is not.

Usage::

    from snagline import Monitor
    from snagline.adapters.langgraph_adapter import watch_graph

    monitor = Monitor.default()
    for update in watch_graph(monitor, "ep-1", graph.stream(inputs)):
        ...  # your normal stream consumption, unchanged
