"""Versioned, per-tenant baseline store (ATTACH_ANY_SYSTEM P1, item 6).

The `goal_drift` detector compares live traffic against a *healthy* reference
profile. In production that reference must be (a) scoped per tenant/deployment
(because "healthy" latency differs across customers and environments) and
(b) versioned, so a retrained baseline can be rolled back if it regresses.

This module is the storage layer: a file-backed ``BaselineStore`` that keeps
the latest profile plus a bounded history of past versions under a root
directory. Heavier backends (DB, object store) can implement the same shape
later; the core stays stdlib-only.
