"""Canonical event schema for SNAGLINE.

This is the only wire format detectors and sinks ever see. Framework-specific
adapters translate their host runtime's events into ``StepEvent`` instances and
pass them to ``Monitor.ingest``. No core code imports a framework.

Design constraints honored here (see project.md §1):
  * Zero third-party dependencies (stdlib only).
  * No raw content retention: detectors reason on hashes, timings, counts,
    and booleans. ``action_signature`` is a one-way SHA-256 digest.

    Everything else is optional and improves detector quality but nothing in
    core requires it. ``metadata`` is explicitly NEVER read by detectors and

    ``side_effect`` (issue #88) marks a step whose action is known to be

      * EXCLUDE volatile fields: timestamps, request/session ids, nonces,
        retry counters. Including these defeats loop detection by making
        every retry look unique.
      * Hashing already-sensitive values is fine (SHA-256 is one-way), but
        prefer hashing only the minimum needed to detect repetition, not the
        full payload, to keep signatures meaningful.

    The parts are serialized as a canonical JSON array before hashing. JSON
    array encoding is unambiguous (``["a", "b||c"]`` can never be confused
    with ``["a||b", "c"]``), and the full 64-character SHA-256 digest is
    returned -- truncating to 16 hex chars invited collisions between
    distinct actions (issue #15).

    The function is memoized (issue #313): real traffic repeats a small
    palette of signatures heavily -- the same few tools over a long episode --
    so the JSON+SHA-256 work is skipped on repeats. The cache is keyed on the
    argument tuple and bounded, so the output is unchanged (a pure function of
    its inputs) and memory cannot grow without limit on a hostile stream. A
    cache miss still pays the full canonical-JSON cost, so a cold or

    The default for live instrumentation: read the timestamp field from this

    same clock domain as the shipped adapters. ``time.time`` is wall-clock
    epoch (~1.79e9) while this is monotonic and process-local (~1e3-1e5), so
    mixing the two makes a single mixed-adapter step report a
    ~1.79-billion-second gap and latches a fabricated, unrecoverable
    ``wall_clock_budget`` breach plus a bogus ``idle_gap``.

    An adapter that derives times from an external record (the CONTINUUM
    ledger, a replayed file) may legitimately stamp its own domain instead;
    that is a real measurement rather than a host clock read. The monitor
    re-anchors rather than scoring a span past ``_IMPLAUSIBLE_STEP_SECONDS``,
    so such a mix degrades to a dropped interval instead of a false alarm.

    Monotonic (not epoch) because the detectors consume *deltas*, never
    absolute times, and monotonic time cannot jump backwards under NTP or a
    clock adjustment (issue #155).
